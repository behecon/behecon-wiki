Contrast between playing a strategic game against a human > against a computer, so it's ToM associated with strategic games. Schurz (2014).

Contrast between giving in a strategic game and either being selfish or at rest. Cutler (2019)

Strategic games are associated with several regions: 

· TPJa takes input from pSTS (reactivity of the environment: social interaction), IPL and more in the social / ToM network to build a representation of the intention of the other agent. TPJ-pSTS activity associated with LESS giving in strategic games [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009).

· mPFC (amPFC, dmPFC and vmPFC-a) creates a complex representation of the self and other, combining their intentions, past interactions, and relation to social norms. The anterior part of vmPFC seems more associated with strategic DM [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009).

· Amygdala sends socio/emotional information to the vmPFC. Amygdala activation is associated with more cooperation in PD [(Fermin, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20982) and in a meta-analysis of strategic games [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009). Also, higher activity in the amygdala could be associated not with prosocial info for DM but fear of not being reciprocated [(Marsh, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcs.1377).

· dlPFC (BA 9, 46) does complex computations combining social norms, cost and benefit, usually to enforce strategic norm compliance (and avoiding punishment); _my take: dlPFC associated with processes that involve past and future interactions, so brings utility from future interactions. See also temporal discounting_. Right dlPFC is more active in strategic giving than being selfish [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009). Stimulating it with atDCS increases strategic giving [(Ruff, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1241399). Inducing a lesion with rTMS reduces activity in the vmPFC-p and reduces rejections in UG [(Baumgartner, 2011)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2933). Also, more GMV in dlPFC in SVO proselfs (associated with defection in the PD) [(Fermin, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20982). It develops with age, enabling impulse control (more strategic giving)[(Steinbeis, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.027)     

· AI codes unusual choices: defection for prosocials and cooperation for proselfs [(Van den Bos, 2009)](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/4/3/294/1633442). _Could motivate action in dlPFC when facing unusuality, complexity, or to react to unfairness._

· ACC works in conjunction with AI and dlPFC. Maintains goal seeking and integrates emotional information [(Touroutoglou, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-64196-0.00008-X), alerts of norm violations (for self and others) ([Fehr 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-416008-8.00011-5),[Chen 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-019-0129-3)), and helps DMN to represent the intention of others [(Du, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2015.00026). Dorsal areas more associated with cognitive processes, ventral areas with emotional ones ([Salehinejad 2021](https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128211007769),[Fan 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.10.009)).
