# Strategic games

## Regions and processes

Strategic games are associated with several regions: 
· TPJa takes input from pSTS (reactivity of the environment: social interaction), IPL and more in the social / ToM network to build a representation of the intention of the other agent. TPJ-pSTS activity associated with LESS giving in strategic games [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009).
· mPFC (amPFC, dmPFC and vmPFC-a) creates a complex representation of the self and other, combining their intentions, past interactions, and relation to social norms. The anterior part of vmPFC seems more associated with strategic DM [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009).
· Amygdala sends socio/emotional information to the vmPFC. Amygdala activation is associated with more cooperation in PD [(Fermin, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20982) and in a meta-analysis [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009).
· dlPFC (BA 9, 46) does complex computations combining social norms, cost and benefit, usually to enforce strategic norm compliance (and avoiding punishment); _my take: dlPFC associated with processes that involve past and future interactions, so brings utility from future interactions. See also temporal discounting_. Right dlPFC is more active in strategic giving than being selfish [(Cutler, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.009). Stimulating it with atDCS increases strategic giving [(Ruff, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1241399). Inducing a lesion with rTMS reduces activity in the vmPFC-p and reduces rejections in UG [(Baumgartner, 2011)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2933). Also, more GMV in dlPFC in SVO proselfs (associated with defection in the PD) [(Fermin, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20982). It develops with age, enabling impulse control (more strategic giving)[(Steinbeis, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.027)     
· AI codes unusual choices: defection for prosocials and cooperation for proselfs [(Van den Bos, 2009)](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/4/3/294/1633442). _Could motivate action in dlPFC when facing unusuality, complexity, or to react to unfairness._
· ACC works in conjunction with AI and dlPFC
